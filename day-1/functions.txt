1: 
Function performing 2 tasks. Improve name
"Valid password" is magic word

2:
    temp is redundant. directly use name.split(" ")[0]

3:
    Ambiguous fn name

4: 
    Inconsistent logc, hardcoded cases.

5:
    Explicit casting
    first checking type and then DriveTo/PeddleTo. 
    Use a commong method. Polymorph
    No return statement when return type is path.

6:
    seperate seperate fun to create file with name and to create temp.

7:
    avoid singleton. use injection.
    difficult to mock.
    or use a wrapper fun

8:
    Many parameters

9:
    send mail should be a different service /class.
    directly using db

10: 
    message.Handle() is misleading

11:
    wrong abstration. for validation
